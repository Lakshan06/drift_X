## 💬 What You Can Ask

### ANY drift-related question! The AI intelligently handles:

**Educational:**

```
"What is concept drift?"
"Explain PSI vs KS test"
"Tell me about feature attribution"
```

**How-To:**

```
"How do I rollback a patch?"
"How to interpret drift scores?"
"Steps to apply a patch"
```

**Troubleshooting:**

```
"My drift score is 0.8, what should I do?"
"Patch validation failed"
"Model performance dropped"
```

**Best Practices:**

```
"Best practices for monitoring drift"
"Should I apply this patch?"
"When should I retrain my model?"
```

**Comparisons:**

```
"PSI vs KS test"
"Concept drift vs covariate drift"
"Feature clipping vs reweighting"
```

## 🎊 Response Quality

### Before

```
User: "What is drift?"
AI: "Drift is when data changes."
```

### After (Enhanced!)

```
User: "What is drift?"
AI: "Model drift occurs when statistical properties change over time.

Three types in DriftGuardAI:
1. Concept Drift (P(Y|X)) - Feature-target relationships change
2. Covariate Drift (P(X)) - Input distributions shift  
3. Prior Drift (P(Y)) - Target distributions change

In your app:
• Dashboard shows type with color badges
• PSI > 0.2 = moderate drift
• Patches address drift without retraining

Try it: Dashboard → Recent Drift Events"
```

**10x more detailed and actionable!**
